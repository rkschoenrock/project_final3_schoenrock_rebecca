            <h2>Welcome to Bluth's Banana Stand!</h2>
            <h3>Orange County's Original Frozen Dessert</h3>
            <p>Founded by George Bluth in 1953, the Bluth Banana Stand was based off of a Korean chain (Annyong's Banana Stand) and sold gourmet frozen chocolate banana treats to the visitors of Newport Beach. In 1963 the banana stand had its official ribbon cutting ceremony and became a major success. Over the next few decades the banana stand would get destroyed and rebuilt several times, with each rebuild bringing in more and more customers. In 2016 the banana stand evolved its menu to include appetizers, entrees and refreshing beverages and has since become the most popular dining location on Balboa Island.</p>
